**The KarambolageNed portfolio**

# Introduction

This **portfolio** consist of a maximum of 100 values whereas the top 15 stock should compromise at least 40% of the total value.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| include: false

#load packages
library(tidyquant)
library(quantmod)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(plotly)

```

```{r}
 
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| include: false


#get dividends
#get data from the Google sheets 
#porfolio_df <- t

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

#prepare figure to plot

```

```{r}
# Display the interactive 3D pie chart
#fig

#print(paste("In this portfolio the top 15 stocks compromises roughly", as.character(round(sum(sp500_df_top10$weight[1:10]),3)*100), "%  of the market capitaliztation."))
```

## Strategy

The strategy is easy: Safe and sound.

Generally, this portfolio has the purpose to add a signifcant amount of dividend income to the regular job income.

```{r}
#| output: true
# Display the interactive plot

```

## Market Events and Performance

Calculating the performance is tough since the money invested changes from to month due to the additional savings etc.

## Long term predictions

For this point, I want to demonstrate two scenarios:

-1. scenario: weak outlook and an average growth of 3% while adding 10k per year

-2. scenario: perfect wealth generation conditions with a growth of 10% while adding 10k per year

Let's take a look at both:

1.  scenario: growth 3% p.a., 10k additional investment from the job income

```{r}
#paste0(print("In year 2023 the portfolio has an income of 180k. Today the value is", as.character(round(sum(x),3)), "k"))
```

2.  scenario: growth 10% p.a. + 10k additional investment from job income

This is the best case scenario.

## Additional thoughts

The goal is not retire as fast as possible. Live without work is damn boring.


## Portfolio as table 


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| include: false

#install.packages("gtExtras")
#length(ls.str('package:gtExtras', mode='function'))
library(gtExtras)
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: true
#| include: true
head(mtcars) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  gt_theme_nytimes() %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Table styled like the NY Times")

```
