**The SP500 index**

# Introduction to the S&P 500

The **S&P 500** is a stock market index that measures the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. It is widely regarded as a key indicator of the overall health and performance of the U.S. stock market and is used by investors, analysts, and economists to assess the state of the economy.

## Market Events and Performance

The performance of the S&P 500 is subject to various market events, including economic data releases, corporate earnings reports, geopolitical developments, and central bank decisions. Market fluctuations in the S&P 500 can have a cascading effect on other financial markets and impact investor confidence.

```

```{r}
#| echo: false

#data preparation
sp500_df <- tq_index("SP500")

sp500_df_top10 <- sp500_df %>%
  arrange(desc(weight)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

# Assuming sp500_df is your original dataframe
sp500_df_top10 <- sp500_df_top10 %>%
  arrange(desc(weight)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  bind_rows(data.frame(symbol = "Top11-500", company = "Top11-500" ,weight = (1-sum(sp500_df_top10$weight))))

```

This is the distribution of the SP500. Scroll over the plot to get more detailed data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(plotly)

# Assuming sp500_df_top10 is your dataframe
fig <- plot_ly(
  labels = sp500_df_top10$symbol,
  values = sp500_df_top10$weight,
  type = "pie",
  textinfo = "label+percent",
  insidetextorientation = "radial",
  sort = FALSE
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Top 10 Stocks by Weight",
  scene = list(
    annotations = list(
      text = sp500_df_top10$company,
      x = 0.5,
      y = 0.5,
      showarrow = FALSE,
      font = list(size = 5)
    )
  )
)

```

```{r}
# Display the interactive 3D pie chart
fig

print(paste("So it is nicely visible that the top 10 biggest companies by market capitalization are taking roughly", as.character(round(sum(sp500_df_top10$weight[1:10]),3)*100), "% of the cake."))
```

Here is the chart of the SP500 since 1945:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false


# Fetch S&P 500 data

sp <- tq_get("^GSPC", from = "1945-01-01", to = "2035-01-01")

#Filter data for the last 2 years
last_2_years <- sp[sp$date >= as.Date(Sys.Date()) - 365*2, ]

# Create a plotly interactive chart
plotly_data <- sp %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~adjusted, type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "S&P 500 Closing Prices",
         xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Adjusted Closing Price"))

```

```{r}
#| output: true
# Display the interactive plot
plotly_data
```

And this a plot of the performance of the last two years:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

# Create a plotly interactive chart for the last 2 years
plot_ly(data = last_2_years, x = ~date, y = ~adjusted, type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "S&P 500 Performance (Last 2 Years)", yaxis = list(title = "Price"))

```

```{r}
# Display the interactive plot
plotly_data
```

It is also interesting to look at the logarythmic chart:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

# Fetch S&P 500 data
sp <- sp %>% mutate(adjusted = log(adjusted))

plotly_data <- sp %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~date, y = ~adjusted, type = "scatter", mode = "lines") %>%
  layout(title = "S&P 500 Closing Prices log-scale",
         xaxis = list(title = "Date"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Adjusted Closing Price"))
```

```{r}
# Display the interactive plot
plotly_data
```

\`\`\`

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false


# Load S&P 500 data before the crash
data_before <- tq_get("^GSPC", from = "2019-01-01", to = "2020-02-19")

# Load S&P 500 data after the crash
data_after <- tq_get("^GSPC", from = "2020-02-20", to = "2022-04-01")

data_normal <- tq_get("^GSPC", from = "2022-04-01", to = "2040-01-01")

# Create a combined data frame
combined_data <- rbind(mutate(data_before, Period = "Pre-Pandemic"),
                       mutate(data_after, Period = "Pandemic"),
                       mutate(data_normal , Period = "Normal"))

```

```{r}
# Plot the data
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = date, y = adjusted, color = Period)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "S&P 500 Performance Before and After COVID-19 Crash",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Adjusted Closing Price",
       color = "Period") +
  theme_minimal()
```

\`\`\`
