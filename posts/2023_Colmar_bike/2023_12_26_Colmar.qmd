**A challenge day: A trip to Colmar and back**

Based on calculations from Google, one way is roughly 46km. This was my planned route:

I started by waking up at 6.30 in the morning by having a beautiful oatmeal breakfast with protein powder, nuts and some coconut powder followed by a small coffee to make me poop. All worked out!

First stop: Tuniberg
