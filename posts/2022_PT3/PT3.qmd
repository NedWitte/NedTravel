**Portugal 2022 (Barienrode-NYC)**

This time, we decided to only stay in the North of PT. Luckily, we got nearly perfect weather conditions in the beginning of October 2022. Funny enough, the theme of that trip was all about the competitive landscape between Espanha and Portugal

In the nationsleague, Portugal played against Spain in Braga. Unfortunenately, Portugal lost 0-1 to Spain
