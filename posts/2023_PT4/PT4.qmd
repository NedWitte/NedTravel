**Portugal 2020 (also known as shark season)**

First step was driving to Hamburg via train. We took a night flight from Hamburg airport to Porto before taking a Renault Clio as a rental car. Back in 2020, there was still the possebility to get cheap rental cars in September. We paid roughly 210 Euros for two weeks.
